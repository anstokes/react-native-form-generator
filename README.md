# react-native-form-generator

Form generator using Formik and Yup, which uses a JSON schema to generate form elements, the schema rules are converted into Yup rule using the [@flipbyte/yup-schema](https://github.com/flipbyte/yup-schema) library. See the schemaExamples for examples with simple/advanced validation and form pagination.



## Quick Start Guide:



Once the library is installed, it can be used like so:



### First import the generator



```javascript

import {FormGenerator} from 'react-native-form-generator'

```



### Second prepare a schema (required)



The schema is a JSON schema, and it has the following properties:



| Key           | Description                                      | Type   |

| ------------- |:------------------------------------------------:| ------ |

| initialScreen | The key of the screen that is initially shown    | String |

| screens       | Object with screens ("screen1": {...properties}) | Object |





Each screen in the screens object can have the following:



| Key               | Description                                          | Type   | Required |

| ----------------- |:----------------------------------------------------:| ------ | :------: |

| title             | The title of the current form screen, optional.      | String | False    |

| description       | The description of the current form screen. optional | String | False    |

| navigateOnSubmit  | Object with the "to" and "handler" properties.       | Object | False    |

| actions           | Object with actions for the current screen.          | Object | False    |

| properties        | Object with form elements.                           | Object | True     |





Each action in the actions object can have the following:



| Key    | Description                                                               | Type   | Required |

| ------ |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:| ------ | :------: |

| type   | The type of the action button, should match the component in the library. | String | True     |

| action | The action name which is passed to the handler.                           | String | True     |

| label  | The label of the action button.                                           | Object | True     |

| props  | Any other props which are passed to the custom component.                 | Object | False    |





Each property in the properties object can have the following:



| Key               | Description                                                               | Type   | Required |

| ----------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:| ------ | :------: |

| type              | The type of the form element, should match the component in the library.  | String | True     |

| value             | The initial value of the element.                                         | String | True     |

| label             | The label of the element.                                                 | Object | True     |

| validation        | The validation rules for each property.                                   | Object | False    |

| customValidation  | Custom validation rules for "hidden", "disabled" property.                | Object | False    |

| props             | Any other props which are passed to the custom component.                 | Object | False    |





### Third prepare custom library (required)

The library is an object with the custom components used to render the form elements/controls. The keys match to the "type" property in the schema.



```javascript

{

	string: CustomTextInput,

	radio: CustomRadioButton,

	submit: CustomSubmitButton,

	cancel: CustomActionButton,

}

```



### Lastly have a submitHandler (required)

The submitHandler callback is sent to all form action buttons, and it depends on the user to implement what to happen. It gets called by the form asynchronously and the form runs the validation rules every time the submit action happens. The callback receives the following arguments:

- The values of the submitted form.

- The updated schema with the new values.





### Use <FormGenerator /> component

Finally our form can be generated:



```javascript

<FormGenerator 

	library={library}

	schema={schema}

	submitHandler={submitHandler}

	validateOnChange={true} // false by default

	validateOnMount={true} 	// false by default

	theme={useTheme()}      // Currently the theme is only used to display errors when the components are missing from the library

	navigation={navigation} // The navigation.navigate() function is used when the navigateOnSubmit.handler is set to "app"

/>

```
